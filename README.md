# Element-in-Array-Closest-to-Zero---C-
Solved "Closest to Zero in an Array" Problem in 2 to 3 Lines of Code in C#

I was Practicing different Coding problems from different Online resources, and found a problem with name "Find the Element in an Array Closest to Zero", and was thinking how it can be solved. For just a clue I went through the google and came to now it is solved by different people by almost same logic, they used abs there, so I though to solve this problem in an different way, I made a logic and implemented it in C#, and it is almost 2 to 3 lines code with simple logic.
